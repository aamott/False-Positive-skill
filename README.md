# False Positive Skill
## About
This is to be used when trying to increase the accuracy of a wake word through retraining. If, in mycroft.conf, you have
    "save_wake_words": true,
    "record_wake_words": true
it will take the last recording and move it into a subdirectory of save_path called "not-wake-word"

## Examples
* "That was a false positive"
* "You should not have woken up"
